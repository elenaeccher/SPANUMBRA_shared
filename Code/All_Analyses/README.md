This R file shows the **Method** and the **Results** for all experiment which have been conducted.
This is a very long and thorough file; if you are just willing to look at the results presented in the paper, we recommend you to look at the `Analysis_Code.Rmd` file in the previous folder.

Because the html file was to heavy to be uploaded here, we zipped it in RAR format.
