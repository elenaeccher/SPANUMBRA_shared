# Information about the data

Data folder contains the results for all group. These results are then further used to generate the final analysis.

 - file `Correlation_Score_Cards_Task` shows the results for each participant all groups (Himba Adults 2021, Himba Adults 2022, Italian Adults, Italian Preschoolers) for the task where participants have to order dotted rounded cards (with between 1 and 10 dots) the way they want. Also, please note that this file is already preprocessed: correlations in the "cor" columns were obtained by computing **Kendallâ€™s Tau**, yielding a score between -1 and 1. Raw data are not presented in this folder to make it simpler to read and access, but feel free to ask elena.eccher-1@unitn.it for more information it (also, pictures of the disposition of cards are available for experiment with Himbas)
 - file `Ordering_Cards_Task` shows the number (column total_count) and percentage (column Percent) of participants to order cards according to a range of different shapes for all groups
 - file `Numerosity_Comparison_Task` shows the mean score for each participants for each condition (Increasing-Congruent, Increasing-Incongruent, Decreasing-Congruent, Decreasing-Incongruent). Mean scores include mean time, mean error, and mean inverse efficiency ("invefi")
 - file `Permutation_Distr.Rdata` shows the ....
